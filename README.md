# OData Integration in ASP.NET Core - Example
A Sample project to explain OData API implementation in an ASP.NET Core 3.x API

# What is OData?

OData stands for Open Data. It is an ISO/IEC approved, OASIS standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming RESTful APIs. It can help enhance an API to have extensive capabilities by itself, while we don't need to worry much about the data processing and response transformations as a whole and instead concentrate only on building the business logic for the API. OData adds one layer over the API treating the endpoint itself as a resource and adds the transformation capabilities via the URL.

One can integrate the prowess of OData into an ASP.NET Core API by installing the OData nuget available for .NET Core and get started.
